![Codecademy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Codecademy-FFF0E5?style=for-the-badge&logo=codecademy&logoColor=1F243A)

Welcome to the E.T.uring Test project! Inspired by the excitement of the 1950s, a decade filled with UFO sightings and groundbreaking ideas in artificial intelligence, this project challenges you to build a chatbot that can convincingly pass as an extraterrestrial being.

# 🛸 Project Overview

In 1950, computer scientist Alan Turing proposed a test to determine if a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. In this project, we’re taking that concept interstellar with the E.T.uring Test: can your chatbot convince a human that it’s an alien?


## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
